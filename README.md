well, not an egg but rather a bug search ... 
this is a almost from scratch remake for getting better understanding ...

for running :
     import adata.json to your mongodb 
     check out the important files and directors 
     
     necessary files : servernew.js (the server etc.) , package.json
     necessary directories: hbs (handlebar screens) , config (database)
     
how to run : all done right , node servernew.js would do  ... http://localhost:3000     
     
what's to be done: 
                  in servernew.js go to the query part and find out why it 
		  does not retrieve data from database , although it's connected
